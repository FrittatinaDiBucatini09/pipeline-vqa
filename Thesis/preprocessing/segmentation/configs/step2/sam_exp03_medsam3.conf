# MEDSAM3 EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# Model Selection:
# MedSAM3 is a SAM3 + LoRA model for text-prompted segmentation.
# Available key: "medsam3"
# Or provide a direct path to LoRA weights: "/path/to/best_lora_weights.pt"
MEDSAM_CHECKPOINT="medsam3"

# SAM3 / MedSAM3 Config YAML
# Ships with the MedSAM3 package — no need to modify unless using a custom config
MEDSAM3_CFG="/opt/MedSAM3/configs/full_lora_config.yaml"

# Text Prompt Mode:
# Controls how the text prompt is built from the JSONL fields.
#   "regions"          → Use visual_regions (e.g., "trachea")
#   "regions_question" → visual_regions + question (e.g., "trachea. What is the position?")
#   "question"         → Use question/prompt_used only
#
# Note: If visual_regions is missing in the data, modes "regions" and
#       "regions_question" automatically fall back to "question".
TEXT_PROMPT_MODE="question"

# Bounding Box Prompt (Optional):
# Set to "true" to also pass bounding boxes as geometric prompts to SAM3,
# in addition to text prompts. This combines both prompt types.
# Set to "false" for text-only inference.
SAM3_USE_BBOX="false"

# Experiment Type (only affects SAM1/SAM2, ignored for SAM3):
SCENARIO="A"

# Visualization:
SAVE_VISUALS="true"
