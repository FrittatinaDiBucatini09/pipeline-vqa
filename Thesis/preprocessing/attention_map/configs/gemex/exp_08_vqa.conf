# ==============================================================================
# EXPERIMENT: FAST SCOUT (Speed Optimization)
# ==============================================================================
# Configuration: Minimal processing. Disables CRF, Smart Padding, and Ana-Checks.
# Purpose: Stress-test the pipeline throughput or run massive inference on MIMIC-Ext
#          where pixel-perfect precision is less important than speed.

# --- Speed Optimizations ---
SKIP_CRF="true"                 # Biggest speed gain
ENABLE_SMART_PADDING="false"    # Avoids calculating body masks/contours
ENABLE_ANATOMICAL_CHECK="false" # Skips bounding box heuristic checks

# --- Compensate for lack of filters ---
# Slightly higher threshold to avoid noise since filters are off
CAM_THRESHOLD=0.50

# --- I/O Optimization ---
# JSONL is much faster to write than generating/saving PNGs
